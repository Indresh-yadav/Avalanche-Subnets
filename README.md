# Avalanche-Subnets

# Creating a DeFi Kingdom Clone on Avalanche
1. Develop a blockchain-based game on Avalanche using an EVM Subnet.
2. Players can collect, build, and battle with digital assets for rewards.

# Setup Steps
1. Create EVM Subnet: Follow Avalanche documentation to establish a custom subnet.
2. Define Native Currency: Set up a native token for in-game transactions.
3. Connect to MetaMask: Integrate your subnet with MetaMask for asset management.
4. Deploy Basic Building Blocks:
5. Use Solidity and Remix to create smart contracts for game mechanics (battling, exploring, trading).

# Project Execution
1. Deploy the EVM Subnet using Avalanche CLI.
2. Add the subnet to MetaMask and ensure it's selected.
3. Connect Remix to MetaMask using Injected Provider.
4. Deploy smart contracts for game functionalities.
5. Test the application and interact with deployed contracts using Remix.
